## SNS Message Examples

### Critical Production Alert
```json
{
  "default": "Critical alert in production API",
  "AlarmName": "HighErrorRate",
  "AlarmDescription": "Error rate exceeded 5%",
  "AWSAccountId": "123456789012",
  "Region": "ap-southeast-1",
  "severity": "critical",
  "environment": "production",
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "priority": "P1"
}
```

### Warning Alert
```json
{
  "default": "Warning: High CPU usage",
  "AlarmName": "HighCPUUsage",
  "AlarmDescription": "CPU usage exceeded 80%",
  "severity": "warning",
  "environment": "production",
  "service": "api-gateway",
  "priority": "P2"
}
```

### Development Alert (will be suppressed)
```json
{
  "default": "Info: Deployment completed",
  "severity": "info",
  "environment": "development",
  "service": "dev-api",
  "priority": "P4"
}
```

## Key Features

- **Per-service event rules**: Each service can have its own routing logic
- **SNS payload-based routing**: Route alerts based on severity, environment, priority, etc.
- **Time-based restrictions**: Apply rules only during business hours
- **Alert suppression**: Suppress low-priority alerts after hours or in dev environments
- **Priority override**: Set different PagerDuty priorities (P1-P5) based on content
- **Custom annotations**: Add context-specific annotations to alerts
- **Flexible urgency rules**: Constant vs. support hours based urgency per service
